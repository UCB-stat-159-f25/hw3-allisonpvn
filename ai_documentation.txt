AI was used to suggest tests and debug parts of my code after multiple attempts.

Prompt: Here is ligotools, a package I am creating. What are some examples of tests I can write for readligo.py? Give the name of the test but not the body. 

Answer: 

Nice, let’s knock out the readligo.py tests.

You want a ligotools/tests/test_readligo.py file that:

imports your readligo function from the installed package

reads one of the HDF5 files in data/

checks shape, basic metadata, sampling rate, and that a bad filename raises


def _data_path(fname):
    here = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    repo_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(here, "..", ".."))
    return os.path.join(repo_root, "data", fname)

def test_readligo_returns_expected_shapes()
def test_readligo_sampling_rate_is_reasonable()
def test_readligo_raises_for_missing_file()

Prompt: Hello, I keep seeing errors rendering my MyST. Is it a problem with my yaml [yaml inserted].

Answer:
This is a YAML syntax/indentation issue in myst.yml (not a MyST bug). Two common culprits:

A tab character or mis-indent under project:

An unquoted colon in the title (e.g., ... Homework 3: From ...) together with bad wrapping
